# fryingpane

Serve the datasets from your package inside the RStudio Connection Pane

## Installation

You can install the dev version of fryingpane from [Github](https://github.com/ColinFay/fryingpane) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ColinFay/fryingpane")
```

## What is this about? 

Use this package to create functions for displaying your package data inside the RStudio Connection Pane. 

__Note that you'll need both opening and closing functions in a package or interactively__.

### Function to launch connection

Create a function that launch the connection pane with the datasets from your package. This function should have this form in the `.R` (change  `mypkg` to the name of your package):

```{r}
#' Launch Connection Pane
#' @export
#' @importFrom fryingpane serve
#' @example 

open_connection <- fryingpane::serve("mypkg")
```

### Function to close the connection

__Important: don't change the name of close_connection()__

```{r}
#' Stop Connection Pane
#' @export
#' @importFrom fryingpane close
#' @example 

close_connection <- fryingpane::close("mypkg")
```

## View the data from another package

You can open the datasets from another package. 

__Please note that you also need to create BOTH functions when using interactively.__

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(fryingpane)
open_facto <- pane_open("FactoMineR")
close_connection <- pane_close("FactoMineR")
open_facto()
```
